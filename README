Thanks for taking a look at my First Project done on October 2018 for my 12th grade Project.
This is Done  for the C++ 3 versions only. Tested and Debugged in "Turbo C7 by Akki".

Before you try to Execute the Program, Please make sure you have performed the following operations:-

* Copy all the Files into "BIN" Folder.
* Go to Options -> Linker -> Libraries and Enable "Graphics library".
* Go to Options -> Compiler -> Code Generation and change "Model" to "Huge".
* Go to Options -> Compiler -> Optimization Options and Enable "Jump optimization".

Now you could compile and run the code. For any queries contact ashwin.venkat2000@gmail.com.
